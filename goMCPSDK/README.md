### GO MCP SDK

Since at the time of starting this project there is no official GO MCP SDK. So this folder is a wrapper to ensure if there is an official GO MCP SDK in future it will be easier to migrate. 

We are wrapping https://github.com/mark3labs/mcp-go sdk which is the most popular sdk for go mcp.

I have not made much changes in to the available repo as from the disscussion it looks like official GO MCP SDK will be almost similar to mcp-go.
